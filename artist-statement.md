# Artist Statement

- What my artwork is.

My work faster than ligh is a control console simulator for a spaceship bridge that is flying faster than light in space. This console provides a wealth of functions to interact with, including acceleration, deceleration, start/stop, light and screen control, as well as starting and closing of the outer shield of the spaceship.

- How my artwork is rewarding to the viewer.

The work gives the viewer the visual feel of a science fiction movie. The audience can interact with the virtual space through the console, feeling the changes in speed and the dynamic effect of shuttling stars. At the same time, the console also provides rich interaction to enhance the sense of authenticity, making people feel like the captain of the ship. This deep immersion experience not only stimulates the audience's senses, but also inspires their infinite imagination of future technology.
